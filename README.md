This is first time I  write an instruction of a project. I am so lazy to write any project README.

This project is about website blocker & It is an AI powered website blocker extension.

To use the extension You need to clone the website from this link from your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafin-edu/website-blocker-extension
```
# Benefits
  1. You will block any website mostly which will consume your time very much
  2. Block a website for 7 days and there isn't any method to unblock the website before 7 days
# Benefits in Bangla
   বাংলা এ  বলি আমরা প্রতিদিন  কোনও না কোনও জনপ্রিয় ওয়েবসাইট এ গিয়ে থাকি। কিন্তু ওয়েবসাইট এর আল্গরিথম এর কারণে আমরা আমাদের মনোযোগ হারিয়ে ফেলি, ঘণ্টার পর ঘণ্টা সময় নষ্ট করে থাকি এবং উদপাদনশিলতা হারিয়ে ফেলি। আশাকরি এই ওয়েবসাইট কোনও না কোনও ভাবে সাহায্য করবে|

# Why you choose this?
  First of all you are safe from data traffiking
  Secondly you can change the code as your wish
  Finally You will get a website blocker and don't forget to give it a star or thank me after using it 

# Setup  Method
Now let's tell about the setup method:
 1. After Clonning it you will get all the file.
 2. Then You need to go to this url or path:
  ```bash
  chrome://extensions
  ```
 3. Then Go to `load unpacked` section and upload the clone file.
 4. You are almost done. You will see the extension in your extension section. Buttt
 5. You need to do a simple thing to prevent all kind of error is that please update the extension, in the pack extension you will browse your extension root directory where manifest.json located and save it.



Finally, I thanks all of you who see a simple project fully based on AI but helpful. For any queris and suggestion [conatct](https://wa.me/+8801990151384) with me. I hope you will help me to update the README information or any grammatical mistakes. 😁😁
