This is first time I  write an instruction of this project. I am so lazy to write it.

This project is about website blocker & It is an AI powered website blocker extension.

To use the extension You need to clone the website from this link:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafin-edu/website-blocker-extension
```
# Benefits
  1. You will block any website mostly which will consume your time very much
  2. Block a website for 7 days and there isn't any method to unblock the website before 7 days

# Setup  Method
Now let's tell about the setup method:
 1. After Clonning it you will get all the file.
 2. Then You need to go to this url or path:
  ```bash
  chrome://extensions
  ```
 3. Then Go to `load unpacked` section and upload the clone file.
 4. You are almost done. You will see the extension in your extension section. Buttt
 5. You need to do a simple thing is that update the extension, in the pack extension you will browse your extension root directory where manifest.json located.

Finally, I thanks all of you who see a simple project fully based on AI. For any queris and suggestion [conatct](https://www.facebook.com/deshi.bangla.2024) with me. I hope you will help me to update the README information or any grammatical mistakes. 😁😁
